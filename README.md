## Endless Technical Exercise - [Deployed on Heroku](https://endless-scz.herokuapp.com/)
- Technologies: 
  - React
  - JSX/HTML
  - Javascript
  - CSS (no precompiler)
  - Axios (for an API call)
- Mobile responsive using no 3rd party libraries, only flexbox and media queries
- Once the user decides to explore the page more deeply, Axios is used to hit an api to retrieve data and update the page.  
- Because the scroll bars have been hidden an automatic scroll event takes the user to the new content. 

### Please feel free to clone/download this repo to review my code
- This application was created from a foundation provided by create-react-app
- Once on your local machine run `npm install` to install all applicable dependencies from NPM (the main 3rd party dependency being Axios)
- Once all NPM dependencies have been installed, run `npm start` to spin up a local development server which should automatically start the app in localhost.
